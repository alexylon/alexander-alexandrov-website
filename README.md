# React.js Resume Website

This is my personal web resume. I used [tbakerx](https://github.com/tbakerx/react-resume-template) as a starting point 
with refactoring, changes and upgrades on my side.

I also migrated the `yarn` scripts to `npm`, as the latter is my personal choice of package manager.

### Start in development mode: 

`npm run dev` then navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Build: 

`npm run build` -> the output build directory will be `.next`, and the static build directory will be `out`.

### Start in production mode: 

`npm run build` + `npm run start` then navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
